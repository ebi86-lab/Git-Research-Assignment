# What Happens Under the Hood When You Fork or Clone?

When you fork a repository, GitHub creates a new remote repository
that points to the original repository as its upstream source.

When you clone a repository, Git downloads all commits, branches,
and files from the remote repository and stores them locally.
A remote named "origin" is created automatically.

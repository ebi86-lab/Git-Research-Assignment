# Pull vs Pull Request vs Push

Pull:
Pull is used to get updates from a remote repository to your local repository.

Push:
Push is used to send your local commits to a remote repository.

Pull Request:
A Pull Request is a request sent on GitHub to ask the repository owner
to merge your changes into their project.

In short:
- Pull = download updates
- Push = upload your changes
- Pull Request = request to merge changes

# Fork

A fork is a personal copy of someone else's repository on GitHub.
When you fork a repository, GitHub creates a new repository under your account
that is connected to the original one.

Forking is usually used when you want to contribute to a project but do not
have permission to directly modify the original repository.
You can make changes in your fork and then create a Pull Request.
